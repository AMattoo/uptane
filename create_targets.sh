# COMMENTED OUT IMMEDIATELY BELOW IS A SHELL SCRIPT TO CREATE THE IMAGES IN
# clean_tufrepo/targets/images.

# This doesn't need to be run anymore but is still included for reference.

# From shell, create directories for targets, keys, etc., and create targets
# files, in the repository directory.

# mkdir -p clean_tufrepo/keys
# mkdir -p clean_tufrepo/targets
# mkdir -p clean_tufrepo/metadata
# cd clean_tufrepo/targets
# mkdir -p images/brakes/config
# mkdir -p images/cellfw
# mkdir -p images/flobinator/acme
# echo "pborih2098gawidopg" > images/brakes/E859A50_9613.zip
